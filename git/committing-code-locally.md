# Committing Code Locally

## Objectives

- Start your project and write some code
- Save a snapshot (commit) of your initial code
- Write more code and save additional snapshots (commits) of the code frequently

## Steps

### Start your project and write some code

1. Create a directory on your machine to store your code for a project. We will call this the `project directory`.

1. Add some intial files to your project directory.

### Save a snapshot of your initial code

1. Initialize a local git repository (database).
1. Stage your changes to the local git repository.
1. Commit your changes to the local git repository.

### Write more code and save additional snapshots of the code frequently

1. Continue to develop and change files, delete files or add files.
1. Stage your change to the local git repository.
1. Commit your changes to the local git repository.
   > Note: these last 3 steps can be repeated over and over after the project is setup to take additional snapshots (commits)
